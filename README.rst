Replay
======

Replay is a simple input recorder and playback sketch. It records the length of time that a momentary button is pressed and released over three intervals (down, up 3 times). It then plays out that sequence on an LED indefiniately, until you enter in a new sequence, which it will play indefinitely, etc. `See it in action`_ on YouTube.
