PhotoLeds
=========

PhotoLeds is a simple schetch that uses the input from photocell to light a bank of LEDs. The more shaded the input is, the more LEDs are lit, in a linear bank. So, in complete darkness all the lights are lit, in bright light they are all off, and all stages in between. `See it in action`_ on YouTube and see the Fritzing diagram below.
